# 📄 30-Days Hospital Readmission Prediction Using EHR Data

## 1. Abstract

The admission of patients to hospitals places considerable financial strain on healthcare systems while also serving as a warning signal regarding the quality of care delivered during the initial hospital visit.

This research develops and validates a model to predict **30-day hospital readmissions** by merging Electronic Health Record (EHR) clinical information with **socioeconomic factors**. 

The study utilizes a variety of publicly available datasets, including:

- **MIMIC IV Database**
- **eICU Collaborative Research Database**
- **CIHI Open Source Dataset**
- **ODHF OpenSource Dataset**

The objective is to determine whether incorporating socioeconomic information enhances predictive performance and helps identify patients at elevated risk. The study adopts modern **machine learning practices** to build interpretable models that support healthcare professionals in both clinical decision-making and resource allocation.

## 2. Problem Definition

Hospital readmissions within 30 days post-discharge pose significant challenges:

- ⚕️ **Clinical Concerns**: May indicate suboptimal inpatient care or inadequate discharge planning.  
- 💸 **Financial Impact**: Lead to increased healthcare costs and potential penalties (e.g., under CMS policies).  
- ⚖️ **Equity Issues**: Emerging evidence suggests socioeconomic factors contribute to readmission risks—factors that current models often fail to capture.
